2.1

1.
  Q: Using "echo" and ">", make files called line_1.txt and line_2.txt containing the first and second lines of Sonnet 1, respectively.

  A: echo "From fairest creatures we desire increase," > line_1.txt
      echo "That therby beauty's rose might never die," > line_2.txt

2.
  Q: Replicate the original sonnet_1.txt by first redirecting the contents of line_1.txt and then appending the contents of line_2.txt. Call the new file sonnet_1_copy.txt, and confirm using diff that it’s identical to sonnet_1.txt.

  A: echo "That therby beauty's rose might never die," >> line_1.txt
      mv line_1.txt sonnet_1_copy.txt
        diff sonnet_1.txt sonnet_1_copy.text

3.
  Q:Use cat to combine the contents of line_1.txt and line_2.txt in reverse order using a single command, yielding the file sonnet_1_reversed.txt.

  A: cat line_2.txt line_1.txt > sonnet_1_reversed.txt

2.2

1.
  Q:What’s the command to list all the non-hidden files and directories that start with the letter “s”?

  A: ls s*

2.
  Q:What is the command to list all the non-hidden files that contain the string “onnet”, long-form by reverse modification time?

3.
  Q:What is the command to list all files (including hidden ones) by reverse modification time, in long form?

  A: ls -l -a -rtl


2.3

1.
  Q:Use the echo command and the redirect operator > to make a file called foo.txt containing the text “hello, world”. Then, using the cp command, make a copy of foo.txt called bar.txt. Using the diff command, confirm that the contents of both files are the same.

  A: echo "hello, world" > foo.txt
      cp foo.txt bar.txt
        diff foo.txt bar.txt

2.
  Q:By combining the cat command and the redirect operator >, create a copy of foo.txt called baz.txt without using the cp command.

  A: cat foo.txt > baz.txt

3.
  Q:Create a file called quux.txt containing the contents of foo.txt followed by the contents of bar.txt.

  A: cat foo.txt bar.txt > quux.txt

4.
  Q:How do rm nonexistent and rm -f nonexistent differ for a nonexistent file?

  A: rm prompts for permanent deletion, while rm -f forces the deletion with no prompt


2.4

2.
  Q:Type the sequence of commands needed to create an empty file called foo, rename it to bar, and copy it to baz.

  A: touch foo && mv foo bar && cp bar baz


3.
  Q:What is the command to list only the files starting with the letter “b”?

  A: ls b*


4.
